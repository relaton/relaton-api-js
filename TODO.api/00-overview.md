# 00 — Relaton API master plan

Status: active (2026-10-28, rev 3: status refresh after the index-v2 and
machine-index rollout; phase files 01-06 and 09-10 restored from the
`todo-01-progress` tree). Each phase has its own file (`{n}-{name}.md`).

## Principles (rulings from this session)

1. **No legacy API support.** `/api/v1/*` is removed (410 for one release).
   v3 semantics replace it.
2. **Structured data, never smushed.** D1 stores each document as its full
   model JSON; queries hit mechanical projections and dataset-provided
   lookup keys. No lossy flattening.
3. **Identifier semantics live in the datasets, not the API** (relaton#109
   pattern). The API imports keys as opaque tokens.
4. **Three-repo decomposition** (rev 2, supersedes the single-hub plan):
   - `relaton/relaton-api-js` → publishes npm `@relaton/api` (library +
     CLI); ships the contract artifacts (OpenAPI 3.1 + JSON Schema +
     conformance fixtures). Current `-workers` repo, repurposed.
   - `relaton/relaton-api-ruby` → gem `relaton-api` (Rack app); history via
     `git subtree split` from the old repo; conformance CI against the
     published spec.
   - `relaton/api.relaton.org` → pure deployment/configuration repo
     (relaton-api.yaml, 3-line entries, workflows, secrets, this TODO tree).
5. **Third-party SDOs deploy by configuration only** — either stack, from
   published packages. Deploy = config diff; rollback = version pin.

## Code-quality constitution (applies to every repo, enforced in review)

- Model-driven, semantically-driven: code mirrors the Relaton model; wire
  names come from mappings, never hand-rolled serialization.
- OCP: new flavor / serialization / key source = new config or registry
  entry, never a switch statement edit.
- MECE + DRY: each concern in exactly one place; three similar lines beat a
  wrong abstraction.
- Performance: edge caching by default; D1 queries hit indexes; no
  per-request derivation.
- Ruby: **autoload only** within the library (autoloads declared in the
  immediate parent namespace's file, created if absent) — never
  `require_relative`/`require` of our own files; never `send` to private
  methods; never `instance_variable_set/get`; never `respond_to?` typing.
- Specs throughout: every package ships conformance/contract tests; no
  behavior without a spec.

## Current state (2026-10-28)

Production: https://api.relaton.org on the `api-relaton-org` Worker (D1 v1 +
R2). REST is still `/api/v1/{document,search,version}`, alongside the
cloud-store collections, `/graphql`, and the machine-index contract
(`/:flavor/index/manifest.json` + `shard-NNNNN.json`). Component search
(publisher/number/part/edition) is live.

The all-parts family builder explored on the `all-parts-family` and
`combined` branches was not adopted: main answers all_parts from stored
aggregate rows (`allparts_norm`). The plan files from those branches are
restored here.
